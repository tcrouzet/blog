<p>Tequila began posting about herself on
InLine<strong>(1)</strong> and other social networks shortly after
her thirteenth birthday. Four years later, on 27 November of Year
Black, when Agent Pi struck, she was still posting regularly. As a
key witness to events and soon-to-be member of the Resistance, she
provided live accounts of the tragedy. At the World Health
Organization, we&rsquo;ve gathered her most remarkable posts so that,
pieced together, they will help us avoid ever finding ourselves
again in a similar situation. With Tequila&rsquo;s agreement, we have
merely corrected some clumsy phrasing due to her hurried writing.
We&rsquo;ve also added occasional footnotes<strong>(2)</strong>, often
with reference to scientific details. We hope reading this will
enlarge your horizons and strengthen your faith in our common
purpose.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> At this time, InLine had become the most
widely used social network by young people. Based on a block
chain-type technology, it guaranteed anonymity in communications as
well as total freedom of expression, even in the most undemocratic
countries.<br></p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> This is how Tequila introduced herself
before the events began:</p>
<p>I post on InLine because I like to illustrate my texts with a
photo that has been retouched, drawn on, or twisted in some way&hellip; I
read your comments and will answer them in my following posts.
Sometimes, I dictate my impressions live, thanks to vocal
recognition.</p>
<p>You know how InLine works, we&rsquo;re allowed 2&nbsp;200 characters
per post, so that forces me to be concise. No, I won&rsquo;t tell you
everything about my life, you nosy people.</p>
<p>No photos of me (especially nude ones).</p>
<p>I live somewhere on the East Coast of the United States (far
from Manhattan).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 17 years old (but that won&rsquo;t last).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough for now.<br></p>
<p><em>P.S. I almost forgot to tell you about Mystic. I never sleep
without her. Her purring protects me from bad dreams.</em></p>
