<p>Friends: I&rsquo;m on the run and you should be, too. I&rsquo;m not saying
that just to scare you. I&rsquo;m writing this at a Texaco station where
I stopped to fill up my old Civic. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re wondering what
happened to me. We talk to one other constantly and I have the
feeling I can read your thoughts. I&rsquo;m going to tell you everything,
even though my Mom ordered me to keep it a secret, as a matter of
life or death. But I only obey her up to a point.</p>
<p>I can hear you laughing. No, you don&rsquo;t know my real identity,
but after all this time, you know how tense things are between my
Mom and me. &ldquo;Tequila, do this, Tequila, do that, clean up your
room, do your homework.&rdquo; You&rsquo;d think I was 10 years old.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll speed up my story, because if I spend any more time here at
the bar with this weak cappuccino, Mystic will get impatient and
start chewing on the already beat-up car seats. This morning, at
ten, my Mom&rsquo;s office gave her an urgent call. Thanksgiving weekend
was over for her. Me, I was still drowsing. I heard it all while
lazing in bed. Around noon, I had just gotten up with the exciting
prospect of a day doing my math assignments when my Mom texted me:
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go bowling with you.&rdquo; It was as if I received an electric
shock.</p>
<p>Both of us hate bowling. The only time I played, I almost ended
up in the pins along with the bowling ball. Everyone made fun of me
and I hate looking like an idiot. So, whenever my mother mentions
bowling, it makes me jump. The absurd idea is a code we agreed on.
A signal. A cry of alarm.</p>
<p>I forgot to explain that my mother works for a government
agency. I&rsquo;ve never told you that before. If one day she invites me
to go bowling, it means something catastrophic is about to happen
and I should take shelter as quickly as possible, which is what I&rsquo;m
doing right now. So, you&rsquo;ve been warned. I&rsquo;m resuming my route,
heading for a cabin hidden in the woods where I&rsquo;ll find enough rice
and pasta to hold out a few days away from the civilized world. One
small problem: an SUV is following me.</p>
