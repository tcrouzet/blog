<p>I haven&rsquo;t just run a 100-yard dash, but I am out of breath. My
hands hurt from gripping the steering wheel. My fingers are
trembling. I can barely write this post to you. I&rsquo;m doing it so I
don&rsquo;t fall apart here. Calm down, Tequila. Get a grip. Breathe
slowly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve hidden my Civic among the tree branches. I can only see
leaves around me. I don&rsquo;t dare turn round to see if the SUV
followed me along the forest track, much less leave the car. I&rsquo;ve
locked all the doors. By some miracle, I have a signal and can talk
to you.</p>
<p>A short while ago, after the gas station, I continued heading
north, with Mystic on my lap. My tail kept its distance. There were
a lot of people on the road. Thanksgiving weekend is always like
that.</p>
<p>Stuck behind an RV, I started thinking hard. Why was I being
followed? Why did I notice that ordinary SUV, just like the ones
you see on any street? It must have been because I was feeling
edgy. With her message about bowling, my mom put me on red alert.
Mystic could sense I wasn&rsquo;t OK and jumped onto the back shelf to
get away from my nervous vibe.</p>
<p>Being in the middle of traffic reassured me. The SUV driver
wasn&rsquo;t going to force me onto the roadside with everyone watching.
He was waiting for his moment. I imagined the worst. Maybe he was a
fed. He was following me because my mom left me a message she
wasn&rsquo;t supposed to. She was being watched. We were being watched,
in order to stop a foreseeable leak: if you had a chance to protect
your daughter from a catastrophe, you wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate for long.
Your professionalism and sense of duty would come second. The
government must have contingency plans for that. Luckily, no one
knows I&rsquo;m Tequila on InLine. They&rsquo;d be able to block my
account.</p>
<p>So, I exited on a secondary road that goes into an older part of
the forest. Right after that, I turned onto the first forest track
to hide beneath the branches. I wish I&rsquo;d thought things through
more. Why didn&rsquo;t I stay on the highway with everybody else?</p>
