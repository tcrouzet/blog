<p>I don&rsquo;t bother pointing out to Alexa that she&rsquo;s just given me
advice, when she&rsquo;s always accusing me of mothering you. I start the
car and go into reverse. The backing lights paint the underbrush
white. Yoo-hoo, here I am. I can&rsquo;t turn off these bright eyesores,
which are normally useful but a real pain when you&rsquo;re trying to
make a getaway.</p>
<p>I emerge from my hiding-place. Branches screech against the
car&rsquo;s body. I back up until I reach the track, a long green tunnel
streaked with sunbeams. I&rsquo;m expecting enemy cars to hem me in, but
in front of me there&rsquo;s nothing but emptiness into which I move
forward. There&rsquo;s no question of turning back. Weeds whip against
the underbody. My tires plunge into puddles of water. I wish I were
driving an SUV.</p>
<p>Did I dream it? Alex could be right &ndash; posting about my life may
make me feel obliged to tell you extraordinary things. The more of
you there are following me on InLine, the more I rack my brains to
please you. So I may be going crazy, except I didn&rsquo;t dream that
message from my mother. It&rsquo;s written right here before my very
eyes: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go bowling with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I come out into a clearing where a hiking path starts, with maps
and trash cans. In the distance, at the end of the tunnel, a car
has just passed on the main road, in a silvery flash. Then another,
and another. The traffic is still pretty heavy.</p>
<p>My tail may be parked near the intersection. I come to a halt,
open the door and put my feet on the ground, my phone wedged
against my chest. Mystic takes my place on the driver&rsquo;s seat. She
looks around, but does not deign to get out. Dead leaves, how
horrid. She&rsquo;s not sure what she wants to do, either.</p>
<p>I walk back to the edge of the forest. On the road, cars are
passing in both directions. Nobody&rsquo;s parked on the roadside, and
especially not an ordinary metallic-gray SUV. I&rsquo;m an idiot. What a
dope! I was fooling myself all along.</p>
