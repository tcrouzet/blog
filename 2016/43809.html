<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><html><body><p>No, nobody jumped me. Actually, I didn&rsquo;t see anyone, especially not
the SUV. And that&rsquo;s a lesson in itself. Just suppose for two
seconds that I&rsquo;m not freaking out, that my mother is being watched,
and so am I, consequently. In that case, it can only be by the
government, with its technological arsenal.
</p><p>OK, I&rsquo;m talking to you via InLine, the network that guarantees
anonymity and doesn&rsquo;t belong to any company, so the FBI and the NSA
can&rsquo;t apply any pressure against it. With all of you, last year, I
took to the streets hidden behind my Anonymous mask to defend my
right to digital privacy. We made so much noise that hundreds of
millions of young people throughout the world joined us on InLine,
abandoning the traditional services to the oldies.</p>
<p>My mom has always encouraged me in this fight. She even told me
many times that Internet couldn&rsquo;t change the world unless we
started using different tools from those provided by the world
before us. Basically, if shareholders are pulling the strings you
might as well hang it up. You&rsquo;ll always be a slave.</p>
<p>My mom isn&rsquo;t so uncool, after all. I suddenly feel closer to her
and I miss her. I think again about her warnings: if there&rsquo;s a
major crisis, centralized technologies will break down first. For
example, after only two days without human intervention, nuclear
power stations will automatically shut down. InLine will last
longer, because each of us is a little part of InLine</p>
<p>Well, all that is just theory. Because to send my messages, I
use my phone. The government can&rsquo;t decipher the data that passes to
your computers, but if it knows my number, it knows where to find
me. The SUV doesn&rsquo;t need to be parked by the side of the road to
follow me. On its GPS map, there&rsquo;s a blinking red light with my
name on it. Not Tequila, my real name.</p>
<p>Farewell, friends. I&rsquo;m disconnecting. This moron in the SUV,
whoever they are, is going to see me disappear from their radar
screen. Poof!</p>
