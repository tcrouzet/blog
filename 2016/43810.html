<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><html><body><p>I managed to lose the SUV. I changed route several times before
reaching the cabin built by my great-grandfather. If they want to
find me, they&rsquo;ll succeed in the end. In the meantime, while Mystic
went hunting for mice in the attic, I lit a fire, checked the solar
panels and the charge in the batteries, and then linked in by
satellite. Before me stretches the lake where I learned to kayak
and to shoot my first ducks. My closest neighbor lives six miles
away. He won&rsquo;t bother me. Bears and bobcats are a bigger fear.
</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been reading your questions, even yours, Alexa. No, I&rsquo;m not
kidding around. My mom texted me in code because, from work, in
case of a crisis, she&rsquo;s not supposed to communicate with the
outside world. All the staff members there are locked down. She can
only communicate trivial things, like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go bowling with
you.&rdquo; Imagine the panic if word of an impending terrorist attack
spread by mistake. The government will inform us later, once it has
a plan, probably too late, as usual. But until then, I won&rsquo;t let
you down.</p>
<p>You think I&rsquo;m trying to scare you? Look what I just found on the
Net. When you know what to search for, you&rsquo;ll find it. At noon, the
President was attending a charity banquet somewhere in the suburbs
of Washington D.C. After the shrimp cocktail and before the
tenderloin steak, she excused herself and rushed back to the White
House. This is public information you can check yourselves. The
sudden change in her schedule is a sign.</p>
<p>Since the government agency my mom works for is linked to
health, I deduce that there must be some kind of medical problem
involved. Bingo! In New Zealand, the <em>Wellington Times</em>
published an article headlined: <em>Suspect illness at the U.S.
Embassy</em>. I&rsquo;ll cut-and-paste it into my next post.</p>
