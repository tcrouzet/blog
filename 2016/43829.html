<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><html><body><p>Here&rsquo;s the article by Mark Mitchell, published just over an hour
ago, at 9 am local time (it&rsquo;s already Monday morning in New
Zealand). Not very exciting, but it is thought-provoking:
</p><p>&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon, an attach&eacute; at the American embassy became
ill. By early evening, seven of her colleagues had joined her at
the Wellington Regional Hospital, but no one made the connection
between these cases. It was only around midnight, when the
ambassador and several other regular visitors to the embassy were
also hospitalized, that suspicion was aroused. All of the patients
were suffering from abdominal pains, fever, and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Tom Buckley, the head of the infectious diseases department,
declared their condition was no cause for alarm, but said he never
took cases of diarrhea accompanied by fever lightly. He evoked the
possibility of food poisoning, since all of the patients had taken
part in the Thanksgiving dinner held at the embassy on Thursday, a
hypothesis contradicted in the case of one cleaning lady, also
hospitalized, but not present during the meal. She only returned to
the embassy the following morning to work her shift, and swears she
ate nothing on site.</p>
<p>The first analyses have not identified the cause of the
intoxication. Tom Buckley has placed all of the patients in rooms
isolated from the rest of the hospital. As a precautionary measure,
the embassy will be closed on Monday. Employees and visitors in
recent days should consult a doctor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, several guests have already left New Zealand. The
French cultural attach&eacute; and his family returned to Paris on Friday
morning. The same day, two German businessmen flew to Beijing. And
the Australian writer Melanie Redwood went home to Brisbane on
Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>This morning, Health Minister Georgia Penrose sought to reassure
the public, playing down the risk of infection, although this
cannot be excluded due to the case of the cleaning lady. &lsquo;You know
how it is,&rsquo; Ms. Penrose commented jokingly. &lsquo;If the young woman
pinched a piece of cake from the fridge, she wouldn&rsquo;t be shouting
it from the rooftops.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
