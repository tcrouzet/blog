Researchers divide chickens into two groups, raising those in the first group in ordinary conditions, while confining those in the second group in an aseptic environment so as to eliminate the microbiota. These two groups are then separated into two sub-groups, one of which is given antibiotics and the other is not. Therefore, there are four categories of chickens: the normal ones, the normal ones that are treated, the aseptic ones and the aseptic ones that are treated. The normal chickens treated with antibiotics grow more than the normal chickens that are not treated; the aseptic chickens treated with antibiotics develop at the same rate as those that are not treated. In conclusion, the antibiotics do not act directly on the animals, but on the bacteria in their microbiota. They promote growth because they destroy the bacteria that burn sugars and fats. Result: the muscle mass of the animals increases by up to one-tenth at less cost.</p><p><strong>1967</strong> Clindamycin synthesized.</p><p><strong>1968</strong> In Guatemala, an epidemic caused by a strain of <em>Shigella diarrhea</em> resistant to four antibiotics <a href=http://www.emedexpert.com/tips/antibiotics-facts.shtml>kills 12,500 people</a> (the doctors, who were unaware of the problem of resistance, thought they were dealing with a parasite).</p><p><strong>1969</strong> Discovery of fosfomycin.</p><p><strong>1970</strong> Adding a fluorine atom to quinolones produces fluoroquinolones.</p><p>It is the time of the Vietnam war.
