<h3>Behind the book</h3>
<p>You may not know it, but an innovation has changed your life. By
rubbing your hands with an alcohol-based gel, you protect yourself
from illnesses. The astonishing story of this revolutionary
product, made available free of any patent as a gift to humanity by
Professor Didier Pittet and his team at H&ocirc;pitaux Universitaires de
Gen&egrave;ve (HUG), is at last told in the form of a book. Written in
French by Thierry Crouzet and already translated into six other
languages, it is being published by &Eacute;ditions L&rsquo;&Acirc;ge d&rsquo;Homme at the
end of April to mark the occasion of the Salon du Livre de Gen&egrave;ve
and the WHO&rsquo;s World Hand Hygiene Day on 5 May.</p>
<p>Being excellent is a good thing. Letting others know about it is
even better. This is the challenge that was successfully met by
Thierry Crouzet &ndash; a blogger, essay writer, and novelist. He is
thereby pursuing his study of various individuals, often unfamiliar
to the wider public, who are changing our world. For Thierry,
&ldquo;Professor Pittet is a visionary in many ways. He is saving eight
millions lives every year, which is wonderful. And he has offered
his nearly miraculous formulation as a gift to humanity, which is a
gesture of peace in a world plagued by war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hand hygiene using alcohol-based handrubs has today become a
standard of quality in hospitals and other health care
institutions, replacing the traditional procedure of washing hands
with soap and water. But few people are aware that this revolution
was born in Geneva, Switzerland in 1995, adopted by the World
Health Organization in 2005, and is being implemented by 170 of the
194 member states of the United Nations.</p>
<p>The foreword is co-signed by Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General
and by Sir Liam Donaldson, WHO&rsquo;s Patient Safety envoy. The work is
being initially published in seven languages: French, German,
English, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, and Chinese.</p>
<p>The author has decided to cede his rights to the Clean Hands
Save Lives Fund (CleanHandSaveLives.org), hosted by the Fondation
Philanthropia. Each time a copy of the book is purchased, a bottle
of alcohol-based handrub rinse or gel will be offered to a health
care worker in a disadvantaged country and lives will be saved.</p>
<h3>Aditional information</h3>
<ul><br>
<li>Nosocomial infections are diseases acquired during the health
care process.</li>
<br>
<li>Every day, throughout the world, at least half a million
persons contract a nosocomial infection. 20-50,000 of them will die
as a result.</li>
<br>
<li>Nosocomial infections kill more than AIDS, malaria, and
tuberculosis combined.</li>
<br>
<li>In the West, they are the second biggest cause of mortality,
tied with cerebrovascular accidents (CVA, or strokes).</li>
<br>
<li>In the USA, they kill 200,000 persons each year. The equivalent
of a 747 airliner crashing every day.</li>
<br>
<li>770,000 French men and women contract infections each year.
40,000 of these prove fatal.</li>
<br>
<li>In Switzerland, the number of persons affected is estimated at
70,000 per year, leading to 2,000 deaths.</li>
<br>
<li>In 1995, Didier Pittet and his team devised a strategy for
preventing infections based on disinfecting hands using an
alcohol-based solution. They demonstrated that this allowed the
number of infections to be reduced by 50%. Their results were
published in 2000 in the prestigious scientific magazine, The
Lancet.</li>
<br>
<li>In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a
worldwide campaign for patient safety. Within this framework, the
formulas for alcohol-based handrubs were made public in 2006.</li>
<br>
<li>At present, 170 of the 194 member states of the United Nations
have joined the campaign, making the prevention of infections a
national public health priority. These 170 states represent 80% of
the world population.</li>
<br>
<li>The number of lives saved each year through these efforts is
estimated at 8 million.</li>
<br></ul>
<h3>Didier Pittet</h3>
<p>Born in Geneva, in 1957, Didier Pittet is a Swiss professor of
medicine. Observing that the rate of nosocomial infections depended
directly on hand hygiene, in 1995 he recommended providing the
disinfectant solution now used by almost all hospitals throughout
the world. By placing the formulas in the public domain, he enabled
all of the world&rsquo;s countries to produce it at very low cost, with
resources available locally (leftover sugarcane husks, for example)
Within WHO, he has been leading a worldwide campaign to make the
use of alcohol-based handrubs a universal standard of health care.
For his services, Didier Pittet was named a Commander of the
British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. Today is name is mentioned as
a possible candidate for a Nobel Peace Prize.<br>

<h3>Thierry Crouzet</h3>
<p>Born in 1963, Thierry Crouzet is a French blogger, essay writer,
and novelist. A self-proclaimed Commonist, he advocates an economy
of peace, based on gifts, as opposed to a predatory economy
characterized by the use of patents. Didier Pittet&rsquo;s crusade and
his gesture to make alcohol-based handrubs universally available
was a perfect illustration in his eyes of the potential for an
economy of sharing. Clean Hands Save Lives tells the story of this
crusade for safer health care. Thierry Crouzet has notably
published <em>Le Peuple des connecteurs</em> [The Connected
People], a reflection on our networked society; <em>J&rsquo;ai
d&eacute;branch&eacute;</em> [How I Unplugged], a tale of digital burnout; and
<em>La Quatri&egrave;me th&eacute;orie</em> [The Fourth Theory], a political
techno-thriller.</p>
