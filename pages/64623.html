<p>On the French Mediterranean coast, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9rault">the H&eacute;rault
department</a> is unique, due to its geology, biodiversity, and
topography. Taking a mountain bike tour of H&eacute;rault will guarantee
constantly changing landscapes and beautiful sights. Between
beaches and mountains, lagoons and lakes, garrigues and forests,
the route traverses the Haut Languedoc and Grands Causses regional
parks, the southern edge of the C&eacute;vennes and Larzac, <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/1153/">which are listed as UNESCO
World Heritage sites</a>. Two loops compose the x727, the external
is the <a href="https://tcrouzet-com.translate.goog/727tour/?_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en/727tour">
727 (600&nbsp;km/370&nbsp;mi)</a>, the internal the <a href="https://tcrouzet-com.translate.goog/727gd?_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en">
i727 (470 km/300&nbsp;mi)</a>. If you like ultra-long distances,
you can start with a 727 and continue with the i727. If you prefer
gravel, go for the <a href="https://tcrouzet-com.translate.goog/g727?_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en">
g727</a> (727&nbsp;km/450 mi).</p>
<p>A grand depart takes place the first weekend of April. <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://tcrouzet.com/727gd">

<p>The 727 plays with the border of the H&eacute;rault department, mostly
staying within the department, sometimes crossing the border of the
neighboring departments (Aude, Tarn, Aveyron, Gard). The i727 is
shorter but harder. Both loops minimize asphalt, favor singletracks
and double track forest roads, cross picturesque villages, and
offer breathtaking views.</p>

<p>On the x727, you will discover historical sites and grandiose
panoramas. Traditional patisseries, bakeries, restaurants and cafes
are hidden in almost all the villages crossed. Campsites and wild
areas punctuate the route, as well as hotels and guest houses.
During the warm days, it is often possible to swim in the sea,
lagoons, lakes and rivers. Less than a day away from bustling
French cities you will feel like an explorer in the middle of
nowhere.</p>
<p>The x727 route is distributed under a free license by Thierry
Crouzet. He maintains the route for the pleasure of bikepacking in
his native region with his friends and to share his love for
H&eacute;rault, one of the most picturesque departments in France.</p>
<p><em>Note: The route is called 727, or 7 to 7, because it
originally started and looped back to S&egrave;te, a city whose name
sounds exactly like the number 7 in French. The start and finish
were moved a short distance away, to Poussan, a medieval village,
which is more convenient for parking and offers many singletracks
on its outskirts. In any case, you can see S&egrave;te floating above the
Thau Lagoon, both at the start and at the finish. The city worth a
visit.</em></p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Medieval towns and villages:</strong>
Bizes-en-Minervois, Caunes-Minervois, Minerve, Olargues,
Saint-Guilhem-le-D&eacute;sert and Aigues-Mortes are among the most
beautiful cities in France, with narrow streets, houses made of old
stone, hidden squares.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Historical sites and monuments:</strong> Canal du Midi,
abbey of Caunes, abbey of Saint-Guilhem-le-D&eacute;sert, Roman ruins of
Ambrussum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grandiose panoramas:</strong> V&eacute;zoles Jump, Orb Valley,
Vis Canyon, Bu&egrave;ges Valley, Salagou Lake (one of the most famous MTB
spot in France).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Old singletracks:</strong> some of them date back to
Roman times or the Middle Ages and are carved in the cliff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>P&eacute;zenas</strong> is a wonderful baroque town with
excellent patisseries and bakeries. Don't miss the <em>petits
p&acirc;t&eacute;s</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>La Saveltat sur Agout:</strong> famous for its fountain
of eternal youth, its charcuteries and patisseries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Escandorgue Forest:</strong> a magic place with ancient
oaks and a sweeping view up to the Salagou Lake and the sea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Larzac:</strong> It's a plateau not flat at all, wild
and mind-blowing, with a fantastic view on the Vis Canyon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wine:</strong> vineyards are all around the coastal
area.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Must know</h3>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Getting there:</strong> Poussan is located near exit 33
on the A9 motorway, 11&nbsp;km/7&nbsp;mi from the SNCF train
station in S&egrave;te (<a href="https://www.visugpx.com/BoVwkDa678">download the bike route</a>).
It is possible to park for free in the center of the village on the
Promenade du 8 mai 1945, or in front of the sports complex, or in
the parking lot of the coll&egrave;ge Via Domitia. On Boulevard Riverain,
bikepackers can meet at the Grand Caf&eacute; Beau S&eacute;jour (open from 6:30
am to 8:00 pm, closed on Monday and Sunday afternoons). Otherwise,
the Saint-Roch train station in Montpellier is 6 km from the route,
the new TGV Sud station and the airport are 6&nbsp;km away. The
B&eacute;ziers train station is 8 km from Vendres or Lespignan which are
on the route.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When to ride:</strong> The x727 is ridable all year
round, except for a few winter days when the peaks of the Espinouse
and the Larzac plateau are snow-covered. In summer, the heat can be
suffocating, it is better to ride very early and very late. Spring
and autumn are the ideal seasons. The second half of May is
extraordinary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The weather</strong> is generally good in the H&eacute;rault,
with little precipitation, but we are not under the tropics. We had
snow in early April 2022 in the mountains (very abnormal
conditions). On the heights of the Espinouse and Larzac,
temperatures can drop below freezing at night between October and
April.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The rideability is good, but the route can't be ridden
at breakneck speed.</strong> There are many singletracks, with
sometime roots and rocks, and technical sections. The asphalt roads
are old or small. Count at least five days for each loop. Two weeks
will be better for a complete x727.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>To ride this route</strong> we recommend a mountain bike
with a suspension fork and at least 2.0 tubeless tires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Both loops are planned to be ridden clockwise</strong>,
as the opposite direction would include many steep and long
hike-a-bike sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile coverage is good</strong>, even in the
mountains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Always have cash on hand,</strong> as some stores do not
accept credit cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you come across a herd of sheep</strong> on the
Larzac or elsewhere, don&rsquo;t walk right through it even if the trail
leads you that way but instead navigate around the herd without
disturbing the animals. Makes one happy shepherd.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Camping</h3>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Wild camping isn&rsquo;t officially allowed in France but
generally tolerated.</strong> People are open towards bikepackers,
as long as you #leavenotrace and stay clear of protected and
delicate areas. Many nice potential wild camping spots are located
on the Google Map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accommodation:</strong> Being a touristic area, there
are plenty of B&amp;Bs, hotels and fully equipped camping areas all
along the route.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Food/H20</h3>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Water isn&rsquo;t an issue</strong> as you regularly come
across small towns and villages, which all have public drinking
fountains. Unless it&rsquo;s clearly marked with a sign stating &lsquo;NON
POTABLE&rsquo; all water coming out of a tap is safe to drink. Due to the
relatively hot climate, we recommend the capacity of carrying at
least 1.5L on your bike. Fountains are located on the Google
Map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Food can be an issue in the north</strong>. On the 727,
finding an open store between La Bastide Rouairoux (km 205) and Le
Caylar (km 360) can be hard on Sundays, notably in the afternoon.
In any case, there are no stores between La Salvetat (km 234) and
Ceilhes (km 286). Carrying at least one day of food for this
slow-going stretch is recomanded. Stores are located on the Google
Map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Most small and medium-sized supermarkets close during
lunchtime.</strong> Those hours can vary, but usually tend to span
from 12:00 &ndash; 4:00 PM. Shops in France are generally closed on
Sunday afternoons.</p>
